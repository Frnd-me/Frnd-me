Hi, I'm Marlon. I'm currently pursuing a PhD with the [Distributed and Parallel Systems Group](https://dps.uibk.ac.at/) at the University of Innsbruck. My research focuses on Cloud-Edge IoT computing, particularly programming models, runtime systems, resource management, and scheduling.

Before my PhD, I spent 14 years as a software engineer across various industries, focusing strongly on computer graphics and digital signal processing. I continue to work independently on software engineering projects, particularly in audio DSP, though at a reduced capacity compared to before.

I've been programming since childhood and have experience with a wide range of languages. My preferred tools are C++, CUDA, C#, and Java.
